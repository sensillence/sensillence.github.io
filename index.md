# Sensillence

is the combination Remote Sensing and Artificial Intelligence by [VTT physical remote sensing researchers](./VTT) and Aalto University Department of Computer science. The scientific collaboration is funded by externel projects such as ARTISDIG and [AIROBEST](https://sensillence.github.io/AIROBEST).
