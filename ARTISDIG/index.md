# Research goals in brief (to be edited)
A comprehensive understanding of the world’s forests can be achieved through their digital twin: an interactive high-fidelity replica of
Earth’s forests in the digital domain. To support actions on preserving forests as a natural environment and not only as a pool of carbon,
a digital twin needs to account also for variation in biodiversity characteristics of forests. The overall objective of ARTISDIG is to
pioneer the science behind a digital twin of the Earth’s forests, capturing their diversity, growth and productivity. This will enable to
integrate boreal forest biodiversity in the Digital Twin Earth, which is being implemented via the Destination Earth (DestinE) initiative
as a part of the European Green Deal. ARTISDIG has a direct connection with European Space Agency’s Digital Twin Earth Precursor
through our PI.

ARTISDIG will develop novel methods to quantify and monitor forests’ structural and spectral variation by applying AI-based
algorithms to interpret Earth observation (EO) data. The ground-breaking idea is to combine physical and AI models, which has
recently gathered attention in the EO community, and which has been acknowledged to be a significant scientific challenge in the
forthcoming years. The new methods are designed to make full use of future satellite sensor systems, in anticipation of their increased
spectral and spatial resolutions. We will use Finland with its extensive field-measured and remotely sensed high-quality forest data as
the primary test bed but the theoretical and algorithmic advances will be applicable to the entire boreal forest zone and tested also in
Canada during a research visit. Results from ARTISDIG will enable to understand the effects of forest management policies in a
changing climate at a high spatial resolution relevant to forest stakeholders.

Our consortium brings together experts of digital twins and remote sensing (VTT), forest sciences and statistical analyses (Natural
Resource Institute Finland), and artificial intelligence and vegetation spectroscopy (Aalto university). ARTISDIG will strengthen two
Finnish Research Flagships by connecting forestry research (UNITE flagship) with AI developments (FCAI flagship). Through
collaboration with stakeholders, ARTISDIG will also promote AI research in forest ecosystem management and introduce forest
applications to AI scientists and entrepreneurs. Additionally, it will directly connect Finnish research with DestinE and the Digital Twin
of the Earth.
