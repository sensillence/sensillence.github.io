# ARTISDIG project

The project *Artificial Intelligence for Twinning the Diversity, Productivity and Spectral Signature of Forests* (ARTISDIG)
is funded by the [Academy of Finland](https://www.aka.fi/en) for 2022-2024. The project consortium brings
together experts of digital twins and remote sensing (VTT), forest sciences and statistical analyses (Natural
Resource Institute Finland), and artificial intelligence and vegetation spectroscopy (Aalto university).
The principal investigators  in the consortium implementing the consortium are
* [Matti Mõttus](https://cris.vtt.fi/en/persons/matti-mottus), [VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland](https://www.vttresearch.com/en) (consortium PI)
* [Jorma Laaksonen](https://people.aalto.fi/jorma.laaksonen), [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en)
* [Mari Myllymäki](https://www.luke.fi/henkilosto/mari-myllymaki/), [Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke)](https://www.luke.fi/en)
* [Miina Rautiainen](https://people.aalto.fi/miina.a.rautiainen), [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en)

# Research goals in brief (to be edited)

The overall objective of ARTISDIG is to develop, implement and demonstrate the Earth 
observation and Earth system science required to integrate boreal forest biodiversity in the
Digital Twin Earth, which is being implemented via the
[Destination Earth (DestinE)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/destination-earth)
initiative as a part of the European Green Deal. As a part of DestinE,
[Forest Digital Twin Earth Precursor](https//foresttwin.org)
was implemented by VTT with funding from the [European Space Agency (ESA)](https://esa.int) in 2020–2021. The
digital twin enables monitoring and simulation of forests at global scale and at a very high
spatial resolution. At global scale, and considering the need to keep the twin up-to-date with the
actual state of the Earth’s forests, the inputs to the twin have to rely heavily on operationally
available Earth Observation (EO) data.


Forest digital twin will be an interactive high-fidelity replica of
Earth’s forests in the digital domain. To support actions on preserving forests as a
natural environment and not only as a pool of carbon,
a digital twin needs to account also for variation in biodiversity characteristics of forests.
The overall objective of ARTISDIG is to pioneer the science behind a digital twin of
the Earth’s forests, capturing their diversity, growth and productivity. This will enable to
integrate boreal forest biodiversity in the Digital Twin Earth.

ARTISDIG will develop novel methods to quantify and monitor forests’ structural and spectral variation by applying AI-based
algorithms to interpret EO data. We will combine physical and AI models, which has
recently gathered attention in the EO community, and which has been acknowledged to be a significant scientific challenge in the
forthcoming years. The new methods are designed to make full use of future satellite sensor systems, in anticipation of their increased
spectral and spatial resolutions. Results from ARTISDIG will enable to understand the effects of forest management policies in a
changing climate at a high spatial resolution relevant to forest stakeholders.



The ARTISDIG project is funded by the program *Key Areas of Green and Digital Transition* connected with  European Union’s
Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) and Finland’s Sustainable Growth Programme and targets the dual green and digital transition of the society.
