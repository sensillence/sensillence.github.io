# Hyperspectral vegetation analysis @VTT

Hyperspectral remote sensing, or [imaging spectroscopy)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaging_spectroscopy], is the application of spectroscopic techniques to remote sensing data. The research on imaging spectroscopy in the Remote Sensing team contributes to the
[Space technology](https://www.vttresearch.com/en/ourservices/space-technology) 
and [Hyperspectral imaging](https://www.vttresearch.com/en/ourservices/hyperspectral-technologies) technologies at [VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland](https://www.vtt.fi).

This research, led by [Matti Mõttus](https://cris.vtt.fi/en/persons/matti-m%C3%B5ttus)
has been funded by several research projects funded by the Academy of Finland:
* SPYSTUF (2013-2018; at VTT 2016-2018, Imaging Spectroscopy for Linking Vegetation Structure and Functioning): Academy of Finland Research Fellow project (Matti Mõttus)
[AIROBEST](../AIROBEST) (Artificial Intelligence for Retrieval of Forest Biomass & Structure, 2018-2021)
* REFORMERS (RadiativE theory and models FOR sub-MEter Resolution Sensors, 2019-2023)

Matti Mõttus is a member of the Mission Advisory Group for ESA’s [FLEX](https://esa.int/flex) satellite mission and an official collaborator on EPIC DSCOVR vegetation products developed by Boston University
